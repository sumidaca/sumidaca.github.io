## What Is the Difference Between Design and Design Patterns?

When someone first hears the phrase "design patterns", their attention would naturally be attracted to the word "design". Thus, from someone who has only heard the name and nothing else, like I had in the past, they might assume that a design pattern has something to do with the user interface for an application, like a recurring theme or style. So people may be surprised to learn that design patterns has little to do with actual design, and much more to do with the software development side of things. That's not to say that it's unrelated to design entirely, but that it's focused on much more that that. It's a similar idea, but instead of being a recurring element on a webpage, it's more like a recurring piece of code that is modified to fit with the program it's being used for. To be more specific, it's a generic solution to a common problem that can be reused as needed. By generic problem, I mean that the overall solution can be reused by changing a certain part of it to fit the current situation, kind of like calling the same method multiple times with different variables. As with most concepts, there are many examples to look at when discussing design patterns.

## How Many Design Patterns Are There?

Of course, the next questions someone may have is what counts as a design pattern and how many design patterns are there. Like when people first talk about programming languages, they assume that they are going to need to learn about every aspect of the subject. And while knowing them could be useful, the odds are that you won't actually use most of them. Like with programming languages, there are many types of design patterns out there, and not all of them are going to be used by everyone. Since they're meant to be solutions to problems, you're not likely to run into a pattern that isn't related to what you're working on. Like if a design pattern is designed for reading and writing to a database, it won't help for a program that has no database the user can access. It would be like trying to design a menu for a site with only one page. You could use it if you really wanted to, but ultimately it doesn't serve much purpose since it won't be used much, if at all. You could go on and on, learning about different design patterns, but it wouldn't be very productive if you learn random ones that have nothing to do with what you're working on. So the question of how many design patterns there are isn't that important. The real question people should be asking is which design patterns do they need to learn.

## Can Design Patterns Be Used Without Realizing It?

As with many things, people may be wondering if they can use design patterns without realizing that they are using them, or that they even exist. A lot of people think that you need to be knowledgeable about a subject before you can use it. While I think you should be knowledgeable before you actively try to use it, that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be before actually using it. As I said before, design patterns are generic solutions to common problems, meant to be a baseline in solving the specific example in your own code. Many things that count as a design pattern are actually very simple things, like writing a method. Using site design again, using a page template for the layout and modifying it for each page would be something similar. Depending on how you look at it, from a coding perspective this would also count as an actual design pattern, since controlling how the data is stored and rearranging it for the user to see is something design patterns are used for, and is extremely useful when designing a meteor application with multiple pages that are similar. In truth, we use design patterns all the time without noticing, from doing simple things like writing to a mongo collection or complex things like displaying constantly changing information to a user. Design patterns are very useful when it comes to software development, so useful that they can show up anywhere without realizing it.
